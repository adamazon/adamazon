This review is 1373 characters long. For those that haven't finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game.I'll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times.I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character.Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience.I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don't really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn't worth it.So, let's start with the gameplay, which in the ME series is split between the RPG aspects, and third person cover shooting battle system.ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ.
